## Installation

# or
yarn add @reatom/core
```

## Usage

import {
  declareAction,
  declareAtom,
  map,
  combine,
  createStore,
} from '@reatom/core'
```

## Glossary

### Action

[Action](https://github.com/redux-utilities/flux-standard-action) is intention to state changing.

```javascript
const increment = declareAction(
  'increment', // (optional!) name
  mapper, // (optional?) mapper for transform payload
)
const add = declareAction()
```

### Atom

Atom\* is state**less** instructions for calculate derived state with right order (without [glitches](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/25139257/terminology-what-is-a-glitch-in-functional-reactive-programming-rx)).

Atom reducers may depend from `actionCreator` or other `atom` and must be a pure function thats returns new immutable version of state. If reducer return old state - depended atoms and subscribers will not triggered.

> [\*](https://github.com/calmm-js/kefir.atom/blob/master/README.md#related-work) The term "atom" is borrowed from [Clojure](http://clojure.org/reference/atoms) and comes from the idea that one only performs ["atomic"](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Read-modify-write), or [race-condition](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Race_condition) free, operations on individual atoms.

```javascript
const count = declareAtom(
  'count',     // name (optional!)
  0,           // initial state
  reduce => [  // reducers definitions
  //reduce(dependedActionCreatorOrAtom, reducer)
  //reducer: (oldState, dependedValues) => newState
    reduce(increment, state => state + 1)
    reduce(add, (state, payload) => state + payload)
  ]
)
const countDoubled = declareAtom(
  0,
  reduce => [reduce(count, (state, count) => count * 2)]
)
// shortcut:
const countDoubled = map(count, count => count * 2)
```

### Store

Communicating state**ful** context between actions and atoms.

```js
const store = createStore(
  atom,
  preloadedState // optional
)
```

### Domain

Domain is area in store thats contains specific data. It help to:

- Organize store structure
- Safety use store snapshots
- Optimize performance of hight frequently updated data (see [FAQ](https://artalar.github.io/reatom/#/faq))

Each action and atom can be declared without name (than it will be created automatically) or with description (string as first argument, see above) that transform to uniq id (under the hood). If you want to specify uniq name manually for above reasons you can pass tuple of domain name and the atom name to first argument of the atom declaration:

```js
const atom = declareAtom(
  ['myDomainName', 'myAtomName'],
  null,
  reduce => [reduce(/*...*/)]
)

console.log(createStore(atom).getState())
// > { myDomainName: { myAtomName: null } }
```

By the way, you can seamlessly specify the action type:

```js
const actionWithAutoGeneratedType = declareAction()
console.log(actionWithAutoGeneratedType('data'))
// > { type: 'action [2]', payload: 'data' }

const actionWithStrictlyType = declareAction(['ACTION_NAME'])
console.log(actionWithStrictlyType('data'))
// > { type: 'ACTION_NAME', payload: 'data' }
```
